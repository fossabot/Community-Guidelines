# Mission and Values

The OpenAIM Community is a non-profit with a passion to collaboratively produce free and open-source standards, tools, and products for the building and infrastructure industries.

Assets in OpenAIM are defined in the broadest sense as applicable to the building and infrastructure industries. Merriam-Webster defines an asset concisely as "an item of value owned." Wikipedia expands on the [definition of asset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset) to include notions of Fixed Assets (or capital assets) which include land, buildings, machinery, furniture, tools, IT equipment, etc., as well as distinctions between Tangible and Intangible  Assets. OpenAIM also recognizes the importance of the life cycle of an asset from Planning, to Design, to Construction, through Operation and Maintenance, and Decommisioning. 

## We value open communities and open source.

* We work to build a global community where contributors of all backgrounds, talents, and skills can come together to create great products.
* We discuss, decide, and develop in the open, using publicly accessible tools and consensus-based processes.
* We share our work under permissive, non-restrictive licenses so that anyone can use, modify, build on, or distribute that work to solve their own problems for commercial and non-commercial use.
* Utilize proven software development and open source methodologies 
   * Semantic versioning 
   * Inclusive, open, and transparent 
   * Encourage development of derivatives and reincorporation of improvements 
   * Minimum Viable Products 
   * Unit testing 
   * Object-oriented design 
   * [Reference implementations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_implementation)


## We are user-focused and deployment-centric.

* We serve users with a wide range of technical ability and organizations with a wide range of technical capacity.
* We believe users should have ownership of their data and the flexibility to select suitable components from an ecosystem of complementary tools.
* We value an iterative design process and strive for simplicity, clarity, and robustness in the products we create. 

## Principles for Digital Development 
OpenAIM adopts and endorses the [Principles of Digital Development](https://digitalprinciples.org/principles/). While these priciples were originally intended for international development in underserved populations, we believe they are perfectly suited for our community.

### Design With the User
User-centered design starts with getting to know the people you are designing for through conversation, observation and co-creation.

### Understand the Existing Ecosystem
Well-designed initiatives and digital tools consider the particular structures and needs that exist in each country, region and community.

### Design for Scale
Achieving scale requires adoption beyond an initiatives pilot population and often necessitates securing funding or partners that take the initiative to new communities or regions.

### Build for Sustainability
Building sustainable programs, platforms and digital tools is essential to maintain user and stakeholder support, as well as to maximize long-term impact.

### Be Data Driven
When an initiative is data driven, quality information is available to the right people when they need it, and they are using those data to take action.

### Use Open Standards, Open Data, Open Source, and Open Innovation
An open approach to digital development can help to increase collaboration in the digital development community and avoid duplicating work that has already been done. OpenAIM believes in an integrated ecosystem of products and standards and will incorporate Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and any other standards as applicable.

### Reuse and Improve
Reusing and improving is about taking the work of the global development community further than any organization or program can do alone.

### Address Privacy & Security
Addressing privacy and security in digital development involves careful consideration of which data are collected and how data are acquired, used, stored and shared.

### Be Collaborative
Being collaborative means sharing information, insights, strategies and resources across projects, organizations and sectors, leading to increased efficiency and impact.
